- **basic Business Plan***
- Love2increase is a health optimization platform that empowers individuals to take control of their health and well-being. Using a combination of blood work, genomic data, and electronic health records, as well as data from wearables, RPM devices, and mHealth apps, Love2increase generates real-time insights powered by machine learning and provides weekly reports and updates on improvements.
- Our service is unique in that it goes beyond traditional Western medicine to help people optimize their health in a comprehensive and personalized way. We use advanced technology such as genetic imputation to analyze 100x more genomic data than competitors, and our AI algorithms are trained on data from sources such as PubMedBert and SelfDecode.
- Our target market is anyone who is interested in improving their health and well-being, from athletes looking to optimize their performance to elderly individuals seeking cognitive enhancement and a sense of vitality. We believe there is a growing demand for platforms like Love2increase as people increasingly seek out non-traditional approaches to health care.
- To bring Love2increase to market, we have partnerships in place with LCS sequencing labs and have developed ready-to-use software that automates the generation of personalised reports. In the next 2.5 months, we plan to launch the genetic and report components of our service, with additional features and services to come in the future.
- As the founder of Love2increase, I have a degree in Data Science and experience in the healthcare and data fields. I am passionate about health optimization, transhumanism, and post-Darwinism, and I believe that Love2increase has the potential to make a meaningful difference in people's lives.
- In terms of funding, we are currently self-funded and are seeking additional investment to bring Love2increase to market and scale the business. We have a detailed pricing structure in place and plan to monetize the service through subscriptions.
- We are also looking for a co-founder with a background in data platforms with machine learning experience or biotechnology/medicine to join our team.
- Overall, we believe that Love2increase has the potential to revolutionize the way people approach their health and well-being, and we are excited to bring this innovative service to market.
- One of the key features of our service is the ability to synthesize personalized peptides in partnership with laboratories based on the data we collect from our users. [[PEPTIDES]] esizing them specifically for each individual based on their unique data, we can help fill gaps in their health and well-being and make a meaningful difference in their lives.
- In the longer term, we envision exploring the potential for [[GENE EDITING]] genetic engineering and gene editing as a way to further optimize health and well-being. With the wealth of data we are able to collect and analyse, Love2increase is uniquely positioned to be at the forefront of these exciting developments in health and technology.
